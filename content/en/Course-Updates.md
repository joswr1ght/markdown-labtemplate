# Course Update Information

## SEC504 E01 Change Summary

Joshua Wright and Mike Murr, 4/2/2019

### Labs

+ Every lab has been rewritten to remove screenshots, replaced with inline text. This change improves legibility and accessibility throughout the course.
+ Inline text has been formatted so it is very clear what the student needs to type to complete each exercise using bold, red text.
+ Each lab has been modified to identify the requirements for the lab (Windows VM, Linux VM, or both).
+ Legibility and format of labs has been redone to make them consistent, easy to follow, and extensible for future enhancements to delivery format.
+ Modified labs to fully embrace the transition to supplying a Windows 10 VM to students. References to Windows XP and Windows 7 lab VMs have been removed. All references to IP addresses and other steps intended to deal with disparate student VMs have been removed.
